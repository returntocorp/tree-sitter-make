Unfortunately the original author of tree-sitter-make is not responsive,
so we had to fork it, but we still want the opportunity to maybe
one day merge changes to the original repo, so for now it's better
to use a different "main" branch that we called 'main_semgrep', so
please when you add changes, or if you pull the latest tree-sitter-make
in ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep, please use the 'main_semgrep' branch.
